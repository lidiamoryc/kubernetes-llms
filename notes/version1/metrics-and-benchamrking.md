To evaluate your AI-powered troubleshooting system against ground-truth answers, use these key metrics:

### **Core Accuracy Metrics**
1. **Exact Match (EM)**  
   - **Binary score** (0/1) for whether the generated answer **exactly matches** the golden answer.  
   - Best for unambiguous, fact-based answers (e.g., "Error code 404 → Check pod labels").  

2. **F1 Over Words**  
   - Balances **precision** (correct words in the answer) and **recall** (coverage of golden answer).  
   - Use when answers have multiple valid phrasings (e.g., "Increase CPU limits to 2 cores" vs. "Set `cpu: 2000m`").  

3. **Factual Knowledge**  
   - **Binary score** (0/1) for whether the answer contains **all key facts** from the golden answer, even if phrased differently[5].  
   - Example: Detecting "ImagePullBackOff → Invalid container name" in a longer response.  

### **Semantic/Contextual Metrics**
4. **BERTScore**  
   - Measures **semantic similarity** between generated and golden answers using BERT embeddings.  
   - Effective for natural language variations (e.g., "OOMKilled" vs. "OutOfMemory error").  

5. **QA Accuracy (Recall/Precision)**  
   - **Recall**: % of golden answer words covered in the generated response.  
   - **Precision**: % of generated words that align with the golden answer[3][5].  

### **Responsible AI Metrics**
6. **Hallucination Detection**  
   - Use **SelfCheckGPT** to flag answers with unsupported claims[2].  
   - Example: Flagging "Delete the cluster" for a non-critical `ImagePullBackOff` error.  

### **Retrieval-Specific Metrics**  
7. **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)**  
   - Measures if the correct documentation passage is retrieved **and** ranked highly[3].

### **Recommended Workflow**
| Step          | Metric               | Use Case                                |
|---------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Initial Filter| Exact Match          | Quick pass/fail for unambiguous answers |
| Detailed Eval | F1 + BERTScore       | Nuanced scoring for paraphrased answers |
| Safety Check  | Factual Knowledge    | Verify no missing critical facts        |
| Hallucination | SelfCheckGPT         | Detect unsupported recommendations      |

For most Kubernetes troubleshooting systems, **F1 Over Words** and **Factual Knowledge** provide the best balance of rigor and flexibility[5]. Start with these, then add BERTScore/SelfCheckGPT for edge cases.

To benchmark AI solutions like prompting, RAG, HyDE, and fine-tuning, use these metrics grouped by their focus areas:

---

### **Retrieval & Knowledge Grounding**  
- **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)**: Measures retrieval quality by ranking the first correct document’s position in results (critical for RAG/HyDE)[3][5].  
- **Recall@k**: % of relevant documents retrieved in the top *k* results[3].  
- **Factual Knowledge Coverage**: % of key facts from ground truth present in generated answers[1][5].  

### **Answer Quality**  
- **Exact Match (EM)**: Strict binary score for verbatim alignment with ground truth (ideal for unambiguous fixes like CLI commands)[1][3].  
- **F1 Score**: Balances precision (correctness of generated words) and recall (coverage of golden answer)[1][3][5].  
- **BERTScore**: Semantic similarity between AI answer and ground truth using BERT embeddings (handles paraphrasing)[1][5].  

### **Efficiency & Cost**  
- **Latency**: Time to generate a response (e.g., HyDE adds LLM overhead vs. RAG)[4].  
- **Tokens/Query**: Cost comparison across methods (fine-tuning reduces long-term token use)[2][4].  
- **Hallucination Rate**: % of answers with unsupported claims (use SelfCheckGPT)[3][5].  

### **Method-Specific Metrics**  
| Method       | Key Metrics                                  |  
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|  
| **Prompting**| EM, BERTScore, Hallucination Rate            |  
| **RAG**      | MRR, Recall@k, Factual Knowledge Coverage    |  
| **HyDE**     | MRR (vs. baseline RAG), BERTScore            |  
| **Fine-Tune**| F1 Score, Training Time, Inference Latency   |  

---

### **Recommended Workflow**  
1. **Initial Screening**: Use **EM** and **F1** for quick comparisons.  
2. **Nuanced Evaluation**: Apply **BERTScore** and **Factual Knowledge Coverage**.  
3. **Retrieval Check**: For RAG/HyDE, validate with **MRR** and **Recall@5**.  
4. **Cost Analysis**: Compare **Tokens/Query** and **Latency** across methods.  

For enterprise use, prioritize metrics aligned with your goals (e.g., **Hallucination Rate** for safety-critical systems, **MRR** for documentation-heavy tasks).
