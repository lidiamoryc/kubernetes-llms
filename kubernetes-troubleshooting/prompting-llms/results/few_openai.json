  "1. Pod Lifecycle  \n\"A pod can transition through different states like Running, Terminating, or Failed based on its health checks and readiness probes.\"\n\n2. Container Probes  \n\"Readiness and liveness probes help Kubernetes determine if a container is ready to serve traffic or needs restarting.\"\n\n3. Container Environment Variables  \n\"Environment variables can be used to pass configuration information to containers, like database connection details.\"\n\n4. Debugging Pods  \n\"Use kubectl describe pod and kubectl logs commands to troubleshoot pod failures and understand the events leading to the issue.\"\n\n5. Kubernetes Probes  \n\"Probes can be configured with initialDelaySeconds to allow time for the container to start before health checks begin.\"",
  "1. ConfigMap Volumes  \n\"When a Pod is run and the volume mount is missing, the Pod is still scheduled, but it fails to start.\"\n\n2. ConfigMap  \n\"A ConfigMap allows you to decouple environment-specific configuration from your container images, so that your applications are easily portable.\"\n\n3. ConfigMap Environment Variables  \n\"ConfigMaps can be used to store configuration data in key-value pairs and expose them as environment variables inside a container.\"\n\n4. ConfigMap Volume  \n\"A ConfigMap can be used to store non-sensitive, unstructured configuration data to be consumed by a Pod.\"\n\n5. ConfigMap Directories  \n\"ConfigMaps can be consumed in a Pod either as files or as environment variables.\"",
  "1. Container Probes  \n\"Probe timeouts should be set appropriately to allow for dependencies like databases to start up before the container is considered unhealthy.\"\n\n2. Configure Liveness and Readiness Probes  \n\"Liveness and readiness probes help ensure that containers are running and ready to serve traffic. Adjust probe settings to accommodate dependencies.\"\n\n3. Environment Variables  \n\"Environment variables like REGISTRY_CRED can be used to securely pass sensitive information to pods. Ensure variables are correctly set and accessible.\"\n\n4. Debugging Probes  \n\"Use `kubectl describe pod` to check probe statuses and logs for more information on why probes might be failing.\"\n\n5. Best Practices for Probes  \n\"Follow best practices for setting probe timeouts and thresholds to avoid premature container restarts due to probe failures.\"",
  "1. Configure Out of Resource Handling  \n\"Kubernetes allows setting resource requests and limits to prevent pods from consuming excessive resources like memory. Configure these values appropriately.\"\n\n2. Pod Resource Constraints  \n\"Pods can be configured with resource limits to prevent resource exhaustion. Monitor pod resource usage to ensure limits are sufficient.\"\n\n3. Troubleshoot Out of Memory Errors  \n\"Out of memory errors can be caused by inefficient application code or incorrect resource requests. Use tools like `kubectl top` to monitor resource usage.\"\n\n4. Node Memory Pressure  \n\"Node memory pressure can impact pod performance. Monitor node resource usage and consider scaling resources if needed.\"\n\n5. Container Memory Usage  \n\"Containers should be monitored for memory usage to prevent out of memory errors. Use tools like `kubectl describe pod` to check container resource consumption.\"",
  "1. Configure Liveness and Readiness Probes  \n\"Adjust the probe timeouts to accommodate for potential delays in database connections. Ensure probes are set up correctly for reliable pod health checks.\"\n\n2. Service Discovery  \n\"Use Services to abstract away the details of connecting to pods. Pods can refer to Services by their DNS name for dynamic endpoint resolution.\"\n\n3. DNS for Service Discovery  \n\"DNS resolution within the cluster helps pods locate services by name. Ensure proper DNS configuration for seamless service discovery.\"\n\n4. Troubleshoot Service Resolution  \n\"Check DNS configuration and service endpoints to troubleshoot issues with service discovery. Verify that services route traffic to the correct pods.\"\n\n5. Debugging Probes  \n\"Probe failures can impact pod health. Use probe logs and metrics to diagnose issues and adjust probe settings for better reliability.\"",
  "1. Container Probes  \n\"Probe timeouts should be set appropriately to allow for the startup time of dependencies like databases. Adjust probe settings as needed.\"\n\n2. Pod Lifecycle  \n\"Understanding the pod lifecycle, including readiness and liveness probes, is crucial for ensuring application availability and stability.\"\n\n3. Debugging Pods  \n\"Use kubectl describe pod and kubectl logs commands to gather more information about pod failures and probe timeouts.\"\n\n4. Configure Probes  \n\"Probes can be configured with different parameters like initialDelaySeconds and periodSeconds to accommodate varying application startup times.\"\n\n5. Troubleshoot Applications  \n\"Refer to Kubernetes documentation on troubleshooting applications for detailed guidance on resolving issues related to probe timeouts and dependencies.\""
