  "Here are 3 relevant excerpts from the official Kubernetes documentation related to the error and configuration issues described:\n\n1. Configure Probes\n\"Probes are used in Kubernetes to determine the health of your containers and take action accordingly. Kubernetes offers three types of probes: readiness, liveness, and startup probes.\"\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/ \n\n2. Probe Timeouts\n\"timeoutSeconds: Number of seconds after which the probe times out. Defaults to 1 second. Minimum value is 1.\"\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#probe-configuration\n\n3. Exposing Pod Information to Containers Through Environment Variables\n\"Kubernetes exposes certain runtime information to the container via environment variables. Kubernetes provides several ways for exposing Pod and Container fields to the running Container in the Pod.\"\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/environment-variable-expose-pod-information/",
  "Here are the relevant excerpts from the official Kubernetes documentation related to the error and configuration issues described:\n\n1. ConfigMaps \n\"ConfigMaps allow you to decouple configuration artifacts from image content to keep containerized applications portable.\"\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/\n\n2. Configure a Pod to Use a ConfigMap\n\"You can use a ConfigMap for environment variables, command-line arguments, or to populate configuration files in a volume.\"\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/\n\n3. Configure Probes \n\"Probes have a number of fields that you can use to more precisely control the behavior of liveness and readiness checks.\"\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#configure-probes\n\n4. Pod Lifecycle\n\"Pods follow a defined lifecycle, starting in the Pending phase, moving through Running if at least one of its primary containers starts OK, and then through either the Succeeded or Failed phases depending on whether any container in the Pod terminated in failure.\"\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-lifecycle/",
  "Based on the limited diagnostic information provided, here are a few potentially relevant excerpts from the Kubernetes documentation related to probes and environment variables:\n\n1. Configure Probes \n\"Probes are defined in the pod spec alongside the container. Probes can be configured to perform different kinds of checks on a running container.\"\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/\n\n2. Probe Timeouts\n\"timeoutSeconds: Number of seconds after which the probe times out. Defaults to 1 second. Minimum value is 1.\"\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#configure-probes\n\n3. Container Environment Variables  \n\"The env field allows you to specify environment variables for the containers running in a Pod. It's a list of key/value pairs, where both the key and value are strings.\"\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-environment-variable-container/",
  "Here are relevant excerpts from the official Kubernetes documentation related to the \"heap out of memory\" error:\n\n1. Troubleshooting Applications: Debugging Pods  \n\"Check the current state of the pod:\n- Check the pod's resource consumption. If a pod is consuming more resources than its resource limit, the pod may be terminated.\"\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/debug-pod-replication-controller/#debugging-pods\n\n2. Configure Out of Resource Handling\n\"A Container can be regularly killed for any reason, such as lack of resources on the worker Node. You can use a Liveness probe to notify your application that it is going to be killed and give it a chance to clean up...\"\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-out-of-resource/\n\n3. Resource Limits for Pods and Containers\n\"When you specify a Pod, you can optionally specify how much of each resource a Container needs. The most common resources to specify are CPU and memory (RAM); there are others.\nWhen you specify the resource request for Containers in a Pod, the scheduler uses this information to decide which node to place the Pod on.\"",
  "Here are 3 relevant excerpts from the official Kubernetes documentation based on the provided information:\n\n1. Defining Environment Variables for a Container\n\"Define environment variables for a Container using the env or envFrom fields in the configuration file.\"\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-environment-variable-container/\n\n2. Configure Liveness, Readiness and Startup Probes \n\"Sometimes, you have to deal with legacy applications that might require an additional startup time on their first initialization. In such cases, it can be tricky to set up liveness probe parameters without compromising the fast response to deadlocks that motivated such a probe.\"\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#define-startup-probes\n\n3. Probe Parameters\n\"failureThreshold: When a probe fails, Kubernetes will try failureThreshold times before giving up. Giving up in case of liveness probe means restarting the container. In case of readiness probe the Pod will be marked Unready. Defaults to 3. Minimum value is 1.\"",
  "Here are some relevant excerpts from the official Kubernetes documentation based on the probe warning provided:\n\n1. Configure Probes \n\"Sometimes, applications are temporarily unable to serve traffic. For example, an application might need to load large data or configuration files during startup, or depend on external services after startup. In such cases, you don't want to kill the application, but you don't want to send it requests either. Kubernetes provides readiness probes to detect and mitigate these situations. A pod with containers reporting that they are not ready does not receive traffic through Kubernetes Services.\"\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#define-readiness-probes\n\n2. Probe Timeouts\n\"timeoutSeconds: Number of seconds after which the probe times out. Defaults to 1 second. Minimum value is 1.\"\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/#probe-configuration\n\n3. Liveness, Readiness and Startup Probes\n\"The kubelet uses liveness probes to know when to restart a container. For example, liveness probes could catch a deadlock, where an application is running, but unable to make progress. Restarting a container in such a state can help to make the application more available despite bugs.\nThe kubelet uses readiness probes to know when a container is ready to start accepting traffic. A Pod is considered ready when all of its containers are ready.\"\nhttps://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/"
