Service Discovery and Database Connections\n\n\"...a Pod may not be able to connect to a database service if the service is not properly configured or if the Pod is not able to resolve the service's DNS name. Ensure that the service is correctly configured and that the Pod can resolve the service's DNS name.\"\n\n## 2. Understanding Pod Network Policies\n\n\"Pod network policies can affect how Pods communicate with each other and with external services. Ensure that the Pod has the necessary permissions to communicate with the database service.\"\n\n## 3. Service and Endpoint Configuration\n\n\"A Service without a corresponding Endpoints resource will not be able to route traffic to Pods. Verify that the Service and Endpoints are correctly configured and that the Endpoints refer to the correct Pods.\"\n\n## 4. Container Configuration and Environment Variables\n\n\"Container configuration, including environment variables, can affect how Pods connect to external services. Verify that the environment variables and container configuration are correctly set to allow the Pod to connect to the database service.\"\n\n## 5. Probe Configuration\n\n\"Probe configuration, including initial delay and timeout, can affect how quickly a Pod becomes ready or not ready. Adjust probe configuration as necessary to match the application's startup time.\"\n```markdown\n",

  "---\n\n1. Liveness Probes  \n\"A Liveness Probe is used to detect when an application has terminated or is not accepting requests.\"\n\n2. Pod Initialization  \n\"Pod initialization can be slow due to dependencies on other Pods or network connectivity. Ensure startup times are reasonable for your application.\"\n\n3. Service Discovery Issues  \n\"If a Pod is unable to discover a Service, the Pod will not be able to access the Service and may enter a CrashLoopBackOff state.\"\n\n4. Timeout Settings  \n\"The `timeoutSeconds` field of a Probe specifies the time allowed to wait for a container to respond. If the container doesn't respond within this time, the Probe will fail.\"\n\n---\n\nPlease let me know if you would like me to add more or change anything. I'll be happy to assist further.

If the Probe fails, the container is restarted. If the Probe fails multiple times, the Pod is killed. A liveness Probe determines whether the container is running correctly.
