        "1. ConfigMap Mounting Requirements \n When mounting a ConfigMap key as a file using subPath, the key must exist in the ConfigMap's data field. If the key is missing or the ConfigMap doesn't exist, the mount fails with CreateContainerConfigError.",
        "2. Error Cause Identification \n CreateContainerConfigError occurs when a Pod references a non-existent ConfigMap. Verify the ConfigMap exists in the same namespace as the Pod with kubectl get configmap <name>.",
        "3. Proper Volume Configuration \n To mount a single ConfigMap key as a file without items, the entire ConfigMap is mounted as a directory, not individual files."
